FederAted Realtime Collaborative Editor
-----------------------------------------
How to try it?(In local)<br>
1.Launch "server.js" with NodeJS.<br>
2.Then launch "editor.html" from a server like lamp, easyPHP... The using of API FileSystem (HTML5) is the consequence of this step. (PS: If you work into a IDE allowing to launch html files is not necessary to use a server to launch "editor.html".)
